                <p>My name is Girma D. Ebbsa. Currently, I am studying Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at University of Washington. I recently developed interest in software development and started taking courses both online and in class. First, I took Introduction to software development and testing at Hahu IT, Bellevue, WA. Then, I started taking Web developemt bootcamp course, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass, JavaScript- A complete guide, Modern React with Redux, React - the complete guide on Udemy. This newly gained knowledge motivated me to start class at University of Washington(UW) coding bootcamp.</p>

                <p>I am currently on the edge of completing UW coding bootcamp. I am interested in jobs as a Full Stack, FrontEnd or BackEnd developer positions. MERN stack is the stack I am familiar with, however, i am open to learning other stacks as well. I am a fast learner and enjoy working in a team.</p>

                <p>My background is Economics. I have taken a bunch of Math, statistics and econometrics courses that taught me, more than anything, to be analytical. I believe my background gives me a unique perspective in the web developemt world.</p> 

                <p>I am a friendly person who enjoy interacting with people. I like having conversation about current topics. I am an ardent news reader. I sometimes believe I read too much news than I need. But it has helped me to understand the world I live in.</p>
